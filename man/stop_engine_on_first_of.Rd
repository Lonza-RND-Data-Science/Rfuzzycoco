\title{an utility function to easily generate the commonly used \code{until} parameter, as used by \code{\link[=fuzzycoco_fit_df_hybrid]{fuzzycoco_fit_df_hybrid()}}}
\usage{
stop_engine_on_first_of(
  max_generations = NULL,
  max_fitness = NULL,
  other_func = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{max_generations}{The maximum number of iterations of the algorithm.
Each iteration produces a new generation of the rules and membership functions populations.}

\item{max_fitness}{a stop condition: the iterations stop as soon as a generated fuzzy system fitness
reaches that threshold.}

\item{other_func}{if not NULL, a function engine -->logical that should return TRUE to stop the evolution
(cf \code{\link[=stop_engine_if_stalling]{stop_engine_if_stalling()}})}
}
\value{
a function engine --> logical that stops (i.e/ returns TRUE) when the number of generations or the fitness
are reached, or when the \code{other_func} if provided returns TRUE
}
\description{
