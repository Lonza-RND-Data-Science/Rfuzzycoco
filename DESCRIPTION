Description: Provides and extends the Fuzzy Coco algorithm by wrapping the 'FuzzyCoco' C++ Library, 
    cf <https://github.com/Lonza-RND-Data-Science/fuzzycoco>.
    Fuzzy Coco constructs systems that predict the outcome of a human decision-making process while providing an 
    understandable explanation of a possible reasoning leading to it. 
    The constructed fuzzy systems are composed of rules and linguistic variables.
